//QUESTION 1: Define a function maxOfThree that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the largest of them.


function maxOfThree(param1, param2, param3) {
    console.log(Math.max(param1, param2, param3))
}
maxOfThree(10, 50, 100);



//QUESTON 2a. Create a function called celsiusToFahrenheit:

//- Take a Celsius temperature from the user and convert it to Fahrenheit

//- Return string as output: "SOMETHING degrees Celsius is Something degrees Fahrenheit"


let cels = param1 / 9/5 - 32;
function celsiusToFahrenheit(param1) {
    return (param1 * 9/5 + 32);
}
console.log(cels "degrees celsiusis  is" param1 "degrees is" fahrenheit "ees fahrenheit")
celsiusToFahrenheit(30);


//2b. Create a function called fahrenheitToCelsius:

//- Now take a Fahrenheit temperature from the user and convert it to Celsius

//- Return string as output: "SOMETHING degrees Fahrenheit is SOMETHING degrees Celsius"



//3. Create an array of at least five Student objects with the following properties: name, activity, gender

//- Filter all those students who are into swimming

//- Filter all those students who are in the activity entered by the user. For example, if the user enters "Basketball" display only students with basketball as their activity
